# Geek Streak 2024 Challenge

Welcome to my repository for the #geekstreak2024 challenge! ðŸš€

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, I am committed to solving a new coding problem every day for 30 consecutive days, starting from July 24, 2024. The goal is to improve coding skills and maintain a streak of daily practice. Alongside this, I will also be learning and practicing Java for 31 days.

## How It Works
- **Daily Problems**: Each day, I will solve a Problem of the Day (POTD) from GeeksforGeeks and upload the solutions here.
- **Java Learning**: I will also follow a structured learning path to enhance my Java skills, completing a specific topic each day.
- **Tracking Progress**: Solutions and learning notes for each day will be added to this repository.
- **Challenge Duration**: August 3, 2024 â€“ September 4, 2024 (Geek Streak) and 31 days for Java learning.

## Day-wise Learning and Problems

### Week 1: Java Basics
- **Day 1**: Introduction to Java, setting up the development environment.
- **Day 2**: Data types, variables, and operators.
- **Day 3**: Control flow (if-else, switch).
- **Day 4**: Loops (for, while, do-while).
- **Day 5**: Arrays and strings.
- **Day 6**: Methods and recursion.
- **Day 7**: Object-oriented programming concepts (classes and objects).
- **POTD**: Basic problems involving data types, control flow, and loops.

### Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming
- **Day 8**: Inheritance.
- **Day 9**: Polymorphism.
- **Day 10**: Encapsulation.
- **Day 11**: Abstraction.
- **Day 12**: Interfaces.
- **Day 13**: Exception handling.
- **Day 14**: Collections framework (List, Set, Map).
- **POTD**: Problems involving OOP concepts and simple use of collections.

### Week 3: Advanced Topics
- **Day 15**: File I/O.
- **Day 16**: Generics.
- **Day 17**: Multithreading and concurrency.
- **Day 18**: Lambda expressions and functional programming.
- **Day 19**: Streams API.
- **Day 20**: Java 8+ features.
- **Day 21**: Design patterns (Singleton, Factory, etc.).
- **POTD**: Problems involving file I/O, concurrency, and design patterns.

### Week 4: Web Development with Java
- **Day 22**: Introduction to Java EE and Spring framework.
- **Day 23**: Building a RESTful API with Spring Boot.
- **Day 24**: Connecting to a database using JDBC.
- **Day 25**: Spring Data JPA.
- **Day 26**: Testing in Java (JUnit, Mockito).
- **Day 27**: Maven/Gradle build tools.
- **Day 28**: Deploying a Java application.
- **POTD**: Problems involving building and testing simple web applications.

### Week 5: Final Projects and Review
- **Day 29**: Start a small project (e.g., a to-do list application, simple e-commerce site).
- **Day 30**: Complete the project and review what you've learned.
- **POTD**: Final project-related tasks or more complex algorithmic problems.

## Daily Structure
- **Learning**: Spend 1-2 hours on the daily topic.
- **Coding Practice**: Solve the problem of the day (POTD).
- **Project Work**: In the final week, spend additional time on your project.

## Repository Structure
- **POTD/**: Contains the solutions for each Problem of the Day.
  - `Day1_CheckForBST.java`
  - `Day2_ArrayToBST.java`
  - ...
- **JavaLearning/**: Contains the code and notes for daily Java learning topics.
  - `Day1_IntroductionToJava/`
    - `HelloWorld.java`
  - ...
  - `Day31_Project/`

## Progress Tracking
You can track my progress by checking the commits and browsing the files in this repository. I will be updating it daily with new solutions and learning notes.

Let's embark on this journey of continuous learning and improvement together! ðŸŽ‰
